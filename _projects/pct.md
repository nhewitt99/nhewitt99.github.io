# Abstract
After finishing my Master's degree, I had the opportunity to take a month off to hike the Pacific Crest Trail through Oregon. This section is about 450 miles long and traverses 11 mountains of the High Cascades. Everything I needed was carried on my back, totaling about 25 lbs depending on food and water. I resupplied for food and other consumables roughly every three days.

This was by far my most difficult accomplishment, but I'm endlessly grateful to have had the chance to complete it. The trail is a fantastic way to build gratitude and confidence, meet wonderful people, and experience all the Pacific Northwest has to offer. Every single day, something will hurt and tempt you to stop, but every single day, something will take your breath away and convince you to keep going.

I've shared some photos here for fun :)
