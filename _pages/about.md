I'm a software developer with broad interests in robotics, machine learning, and computer science.
Passionate about solving messy, meaningful problems.
Currently open to work: if you have an opening that sounds like this, please reach out!

I received my M.S. in Robotics at Oregon State University under the advising of [Dr. Kagan Tumer](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~ktumer/).
I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, *summa cum laude*.

Over five years of collaborative research, I have acquired a wide skillset (check out my [Projects](/projects) to learn more):
- **Python:** PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter, Anaconda
- **Machine learning:** deep, evolutionary, reinforcement
- **Mathematics:** Bayesian statistics, graph theory, linear algebra
- **Linux:** networking, services, SSH, basic admin, Docker
- **Hardware:** UR5, Arduino, depth cameras, embedded C
- **Robotics:** C++, ROS 1 and 2, SLAM, control
- **Good development practices:** Git, testing, OOP

I enjoy backpacking, rock climbing, and reading [weird books](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books-read/nhewitt99). While I have your attention, have you [contributed to Wikipedia](https://donate.wikimedia.org) this year?
