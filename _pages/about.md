I'm a software developer with broad interests in robotics, machine learning, and computer science.
Passionate about solving messy, meaningful problems.

I received my M.S. in Robotics at Oregon State University under the advising of [Dr. Kagan Tumer](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~ktumer/).
I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, *summa cum laude*.

I enjoy backpacking, rock climbing, and reading [weird books](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books-read/nhewitt99). While I have your attention, have you [contributed to Wikipedia](https://donate.wikimedia.org) this year?
