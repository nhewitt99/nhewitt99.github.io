I am a Robotics PhD student at Oregon State University under the advising of [Dr. Kagan Tumer](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~ktumer/). I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, *summa cum laude*.

Current research interests involve multiagent robotic systems that can handle dynamic, uncertain environments, working at the intersection of evolutionary, deep, and reinforcement learning. How can these systems be modeled to easily shape their behaviors? How can they account for unknown unknowns while remaining computationally tractable? What are the limits of a system's ability to adapt to changing environments and goals? And, how can we use these systems to improve our society, without exacerbating issues of inequity and privacy?
